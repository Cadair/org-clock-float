* Org Clock Float

This is a small emacs package which sends my clocked time up to [[float.com][float.com]] a time tracking and scheduling web service.

** Configuration

To configure upload to float you need to set your email and an API token, unfortunately the Float API only appears to be team-wide, so you need the token from the Account Owner: https://support.float.com/en/articles/55483-api
You might want to use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/auth/index.html][auth-source]] to store the token.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package request)
(use-package org-clock-float
  :requires (request)
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/Cadair/org-clock-float.git" :rev :latest)  ;; this requires emacs 30
  :custom
  (org-clock-float-email "youremail@example.com")
  (org-clock-float-api-token "aslkdjaslkjdlakjdlksa")
  )
#+end_src

** Tagging Tasks

Only tasks tagged with a matching tag are uploaded to float. The format of the tag is ~float_<project name>~, so if you have a project in float named "client1" you would have a task which looks like this:

#+begin_src org
  * TODO Work on thing :float_client1:
#+end_src

Any spaces in the project name should be replaced with ~_~, so a project named ~My Client~ would use a tag ~:float_My_Client:~.
